This code is based off of the code that I based off of the tutorial on LearnOpenGL.com
I have changed to OpenGL 4.5 so I can port some CUDA code from University over to OpenGL compute shaders.

---------------

This does use CMake so that I am capable of working on this on either a Windows or Linux machine
