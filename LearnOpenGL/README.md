This code is based off of the tutorial on LearnOpenGL.com
I have made my own modifications for pactice.
Mostly just spliting the main.cpp into multiple classes

---------------

This does use CMake so that I can eventually be capable of working on the code wherever I am, regardless of whether I am on Windows or Linux. However the CMakeLists.txt right now only works for linux.
I will get around to making it work for Windows once I have free time while on a Windows Machine.
